Graph is a non-linear Data Structure consisting of Vertices and Edeges.

Vertex => (Data/Info)
Edege => Path between two vertex (which can have some weight)

Eg. 
     10           10           10
A ----------B-----------C------------D
|           |           `
|5          | 5     `3
|           |    `
E-----------F`
     10

Here 
A => Vertex
A -- B => Edege
