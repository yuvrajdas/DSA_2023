Graph is a non-linear Data Structure consisting of Vertices and Edeges. OR Network of node

Vertices => (Data Pointer)
Edeges => (Path between Two Nodes)

Types of Graph :
1. Directed Graph (With weight / without weight)
2. Un-Directed Graph (With weight / without wieght)

    Eg. Directed Graph
A------------>B------------->C
|             |           `arrow
|             |       `
|             |    `
|arrow        |  ` 
D------------->E`


    Eg. Undirected Graph.
A-------------B-------------C
|             |           `
|             |       `
|             |    `
|             |  ` 
D-------------E`
